## üìñ Overview

The `AIShortsDownloader` is a robust Python-based system designed to automate the process of finding, selecting, and downloading short videos from designated YouTube channels. It's built for content creators, marketers, or anyone needing to collect relevant short-form video content based on defined criteria (keywords, channel IDs) for analysis, curation, or creative projects. The system manages downloaded content, logs operations, generates reports, and provides backup functionalities, ensuring an efficient and organized workflow.

## ‚ú® Features

-   üéØ **YouTube Channel Monitoring**: Automatically fetches video data from a configurable list of YouTube channels.
-   üí° **Intelligent Short Video Selection**: Filters and selects shorts based on user-defined keywords and criteria, ensuring relevance.
-   ‚¨áÔ∏è **High-Quality Video Downloading**: Leverages `yt-dlp` to download selected YouTube Shorts in the best available quality.
-   üóÑÔ∏è **Local Database Management**: Uses SQLite to track downloaded shorts, preventing duplicates and managing metadata.
-   ‚öôÔ∏è **Highly Configurable Settings**: All operational parameters, including API keys, channels, keywords, and paths, are easily managed via `settings.json`.
-   üìä **Automated Logging & Reporting**: Records all operations and activities, and generates reports for oversight and analysis.
-   üíæ **Built-in Backup Mechanism**: Automatically backs up critical data at configurable intervals.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
-   **Python 3.x**: Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
    ```bash
    python --version
    ```
-   **YouTube Data API Key**: Obtain a YouTube Data API v3 key from the Google Cloud Console.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yusufnightin/AIShortsDownloader.git
    cd AIShortsDownloader
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Configuration setup**
    *   Open `settings.json` in the root directory.
    *   Replace `"YOUR_YOUTUBE_API_KEY"` with your actual Google YouTube Data API Key.
    *   Update `channel_ids` with the YouTube channel IDs you wish to monitor.
    *   Modify `keywords` to include relevant terms for selecting shorts.
    *   Adjust `download_path`, `log_level`, `max_shorts_per_channel`, and `backup_interval_days` as needed.

    Example `settings.json`:
    ```json
    {
      "youtube_api_key": "YOUR_YOUTUBE_API_KEY",
      "channel_ids": [
        "UC_x5XG1OV2P6uZZ5FSM9Ttw",
        "UC-9-kyTW8ZkZNDHQJ6FgpwQ"
      ],
      "keywords": [
        "tutorial",
        "coding",
        "funny moments",
        "tech review"
      ],
      "download_path": "downloaded_shorts",
      "log_level": "INFO",
      "max_shorts_per_channel": 5,
      "backup_interval_days": 3
    }
    ```

4.  **Run the downloader**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    The script will start monitoring channels, selecting, and downloading shorts based on your configuration.
